## **Solution**

To tackle this task, you decide to implement the **quicksort algorithm**. Quicksort is known for its efficiency in sorting large datasets. It works by selecting a pivot element from the dataset and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. This process is repeated recursively on the sub-arrays until the entire dataset is sorted.

Once you have sorted the data using quicksort, you can leverage the power of **binary search** to find specific products quickly. Binary search is a search algorithm that works efficiently on sorted lists. It repeatedly divides the search space in half by comparing the search value with the middle element of the sorted list. By discarding the half in which the search value cannot exist, it rapidly converges on the desired element.

## **Real-World Application**

Now, let's consider a real-world scenario. Suppose you are developing a search feature for an online shopping platform. Users are often looking for products based on specific criteria such as price range, category, or brand. By applying the quicksort algorithm to sort the product data based on these criteria, you can provide users with a sorted list of products that match their preferences, making it easier for them to find what they're looking for.

Additionally, when a user enters a search query, you can leverage the efficiency of the binary search algorithm to quickly locate the desired products within the sorted list. This way, users can receive search results in a fraction of the time it would take with a linear search, enabling a more responsive and enjoyable shopping experience.
